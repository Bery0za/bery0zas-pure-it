# Bery0za's Pure It
![Alt text](https://mods-data.factorio.com/assets/ea2ea69ca4bd10c500db4e6042563fabcd9ee8a3.png)
Brand new Factorio mod allowing you to make the skies brighter and clearer. Please note that this is a **Work-In-Progress** mod, so things will change often. Don't forget to make a backup copy of your immersive constructions.

## Idea and philosophy
The idea of this mod came to me after long play sessions with my friend, during which we raided local fauna and its nests. Quite aggressive fauna need to say. That’s understandable: you’re here on your own planet, growing your lovely bloody toxic children, but suddenly a cloud of acids comes to your place and makes your life awful. So, you rise up an army to fight back and destroy all those blast furnaces and chemical plants to the ground. But actually, those are our plants, and we don’t like them to be demolished on our way to the bright future. So, I decided to make the life on the planet slightly brighter. Literally. By making the skies clearer and purer.

I wanted this mod to be based on real world techniques of air filtering, but I left an opportunity to be creative in questions of graphics and recipes. So, I hope we got a hybrid thing here that feels like a part of Factorio but can also prompt us to learn new things about the environment.

Control script of this mod is based on [Better Air Filtering](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/better-air-filtering) by [JoeyDP](https://mods.factorio.com/user/joeydp), but it was modified to meet my needs and become more difficult to play. This means that pollution is dispersed back into the atmosphere not only when an entity containing pollution is destroyed or mined, but also when it had stored some critical amount of pollution or polluted water. Though I left an option to switch this feature off and stay UPS efficient.

Operational radii of air sucking machines are *8, 16, and 24* tiles for *Mk1, Mk2, Mk3* respectively. Those tiles are divided between chunks depending on the sucker position, leaving every chunk only some fraction of total machine capacity.
